            It must mean you've been going quite a ways around on my site.
            Hopefully, this means you're a potential employer, and Hopefully,
            you found this by manually typing in a url and not through a
            misdirecting hyperlink on the site.<br />
            If you are a potential employer, I hope you've found something
            that's piqued your interest. If you haven't, then maybe you should
            check out my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> or my
            <a href="resume.html">resume</a> and see if any of those can change
            your mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, if you're here after clicking a link on the site, please
            <a href="mailto:felix@krog.dk?subject=Your website has a 404 link"
              >let me know</a
            >
            and describe on what page you found the non-functional hyperlink.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, if you're curious about the image, it's an old photo-edit of
            mine I just didn't have anywhere else to put.
