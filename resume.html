          <h2>Spare Time</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Bouldering:</b><br />
            I spend a lot of my free time bouldering with friends in the
            different Boulders gyms. I typically go for multiple sessions every
            week, and have sent problems of up to V6 difficulty.<br />
            <b>Games:</b><br />
            I also enjoy playing games of both the board and video variety. My
            current favourite video game is "The World Ends With You" (2007,
            DS), as it utilises everything the DS has to offer to such an extend
            that it feels as if the console was made specifically for the game.
            Packed with an interesting story with memorable characters, it makes
            for an incredible gameplay experience.
